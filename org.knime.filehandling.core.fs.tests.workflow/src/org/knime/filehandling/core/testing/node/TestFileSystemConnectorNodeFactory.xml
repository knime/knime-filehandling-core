    <name>Test File System Connector</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
        Opens a file system connection to a file system for testing purposes.

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        This node does two things:
        
        <ul>
        <li>It initiates a connection to a file system.</li>
        <li>it (optionally) copies some local files ("fixture files") to the file system.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        The file system is configured by the fs-test.properties file, which can be supplied in two ways:
        <ul>
	        <li>By putting it into the root of your KNIME workspace.</li>
	        <li>By setting an environment variable called "KNIME_FS_TEST_PROPERTIES", which specifies the path to the file.</li>
        </ul>
        The file system will have a working directory that is created ad-hoc with a unique, randomized name.
        The working directory and its contents will be recursively deleted when this node is reset or the containing KNIME workflow is closed.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The fixtures files are copied from a local directory, which is also specified in the fs-test.properties file.
        The contents of the local fixture directory will be recursively copied to a folder called "fixtures" directly below
        the working directory of the file system.
        </p>
         
        The purpose of this node is to allow execution of the same testflow for a variety of different file systems.
        </intro>
        <option name="Fixture upload filter">A filter (either glob or regex) to prune the tree of fixture files to upload.
            The filter must match a relative path to the fixture file (relative with respect to the local fixture directory).
            Example filter: "glob:my_csv/*.csv", will upload all *.csv files in the "my_csv" subdirectory of the fixture directory.
            
            <p>
            The filter syntax is described in the
            <a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher-java.lang.String-'>
            Javadoc of java.nio.file.FileSystem.getPathMatcher()</a>.
